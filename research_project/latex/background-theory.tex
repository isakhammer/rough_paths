\label{sec:background}



The concept of the signature approach is to extract characteristic features from a data, that is a function or data points in a non parametric way.
First we want to define the so-called path integral.
Consider a two parameterized one dimensional paths  $Y_{t}: [a,b] \to  \mathbb{R} ^{d} $ and $X_t: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R} $, then we say the path integral of $Y_{t}$ against $X_{t}$  is \begin{equation}
    \int_{a}^{b} Y_{t} dX_{t} = \int_{a}^{b}  Y_{t} \dot{X_{t}}dt,
\end{equation}  where we defined $ \dot{X_{t}} = \frac{d}{dt}X( t)   $. Following \cite{Reizenstein2016} and  \cite{chevyrev2016primer}, will we explain the basic definition of a signature.



A fundamental piece in the definition of a signature is
the so-called path integral.
Lets consider the parametrized smooth path of $d$ dimensions be $X_{t}: \left[ a,b \right] \to  \mathbb{R} ^{d}  $ such that $X_{t} = \left\{ X^{1}_{t},  X_{t}^{2}, \ldots, X_{t}^{d} \right\} $. Now since each path is $X^{i}_{t}: [a,b] \to
\mathbb{R} $ for $i \in \left\{ 1, \ldots, d \right\} $ , we say define the integral \begin{equation}
    S( X)_{a,t}^{i} =  \int_{a < s < t}^{} dX^{i} = X^{i}_{t} - X_{0}^{i}
\end{equation}

Similarly we define the double-iterated double integral \begin{equation*}
    S( X)^{i,j}_{a,t} = \int_{a < s<t}^{} S( X)_{a,s}^{i}dX^{j}_{s} = \int_{\substack{a < r < t \\ a < s < t}}^{} dX^{i}_{r} dX^{j}_{s}
\end{equation*}


 Continuing recursively we obtain the definition \begin{equation*}
     S( X) _{a,t}^{i_{1},\ldots, i_{k}} =  \int_{a < s <t}^{} S( X) ^{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k-1}} dX^{i_{k}}_{s}
 \end{equation*}
 where $i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k} \in \left\{ 1, \ldots, d \right\} $. Notice that we still obtain the mapping $S( X)^{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k}}: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}  $.  Finally we have the tools rquired to define a signature.

 \begin{definition}[Signature]
     We say a signature of a path $X: \left[ a,b \right] \to  \mathbb{R} ^{d} $, denoted by $S( X) _{a,b}$ is the collection of all the iterated integrals of $X$. Thus we, nor have the sequence of numbers \begin{equation}
     \begin{split}
         S( X) _{a,b}  = & ( 1,  S( X) ^{1}_{a,b}, \ldots, S( X) ^{d}_{a,b}, S( X) ^{1,1}_{a,b}, \\ & \ \  S( X) ^{1,2} _{a,b}, S( X) _{a,b}^{2,1}, \ldots).
     \end{split}
     \end{equation}

     Here the first term is defined as $1$. Keep in mind that we iterate over all multi-indexes, that is the set \begin{equation}
W =\left\{
         \begin{split}
           ( i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k})  \text{ where }  k \ge 1, \\
         \text{ for all } i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k} \in \left\{ 1,\ldots,d \right\} .
         \end{split}
\right\}
     \end{equation}

     We denote the set $W$ as words and $ A = \left\{ 1, \ldots, d \right\} $ as the alphabet of $d $ letters .
 \end{definition}


One of the most fundamental properties of the signature is its invariance under time reparameterization. This can easily be demonstrated using the definitions of the path integral. Consider two paths $X,Y: \left[ a,b \right] \to \mathbb{R}$, which
are real-valued. Now, consider two corresponding reparameterized paths $\widetilde{X}, \widetilde{Y}: \left[ a,b \right] \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\widetilde{X}_{t} = X_{\psi(t)}$ and $\widetilde{Y} = Y_{\psi(t)}$, with some smooth reparameterization $\psi: [a,b]
\to [a,b]$. From the chain rule it is clear that $$\frac{d}{dt} \widetilde{X}_{ t } = \dot{ \widetilde{X}_{ t }}  \dot{ \psi} ( t)  $$, thus it follows that \begin{equation}
    \int_{a}^{b }  \widetilde{Y}_{t} d\widetilde{X}_{t} = \int_{a}^{b}  Y_{\psi ( t) }\dot{X} _{\psi ( t) } \dot{\psi}( t) = \int_{a}^{b}  Y_{u} dX_{u}
\end{equation}

Here we used the subsitution $u = \psi ( t)  $. This is of course applicable in the multidimensional case in the case of a signature. Let $\widetilde{X},X: \left[ a,b \right] \to \mathbb{R} d$ where $\widetilde{X}_{t} = X_{t}$.Then we see that \begin{equation}
    S( \widetilde{X}) _{a,b}^{i_{1},\ldots, i_{k}} = S( X) ^{i_{1},\ldots, i_{k}}_{a,b}
\end{equation}

for any $i_{1},\ldots, i_{k} \in  \left\{ 1,\ldots,d \right\} $. Thus we see that the signature is, in fact, invariant under time re parameterization.

\subsection{Shuffle product}%
\label{sub:shuffle_product}


A fundamental property of the signature is that the product of two signature terms \( S(X)_a^{i_1,\dots,i_k,b} \) and \( S(X)_a^{j_1,\dots,j_m,b} \) can be expressed as a sum of terms depending on shuffled multi-indexes.

To formalize this, we define the shuffle product for two multi-indexes. A permutation \( \sigma \) of the set \( \{1, \dots, k+m\} \) is called a \((k,m)\)-shuffle if \( \sigma^{-1}(1) < \dots < \sigma^{-1}(k) \) and \( \sigma^{-1}(k+1) < \dots < \sigma^{-1}(k+m) \). The list \( (\sigma(1), \dots, \sigma(k+m)) \) forms a shuffle of \( (1, \dots, k) \) and \( (k+1, \dots, k+m) \). Let \( \text{Shuffles}(k,m) \) denote the collection of all such shuffles.

For multi-indexes \( I = (i_1, \dots, i_k) \) and \( J = (j_1, \dots, j_m) \) with \( i_1, \dots, i_k, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \{1, \dots, d\} \), define the multi-index
\[
 I \shuffle J =\left\{   (\sigma(1), \dots, \sigma(k+m)) \mid \sigma \in \text{Shuffles}(k,m) \right\} .
\]
Thus, we have that The shuffle product \( I \shuffle J \) is the set of multi-indexes of length \( k+m \).

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{Shuffle product identity} For a path \( X: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^d \) and multi-indexes \( I = (i_1, \dots, i_k) \) and \( J = (j_1, \dots, j_m) \), it holds that
\[
S(X)_a^b S(X)_a^b = \sum_{K \in I \shuffle J} S(X)_a^{K,b}.
\]
\end{theorem}




Let the terms $e_{i_{1}}, \ldots, e_{i_{k}} $ be monomials. Then we can denote the representation $S( X) _{a,b}$  as a formal power series \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:representation}
S(X )  _{a,b} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}  \sum_{i_{1},\ldots , i_{k}}^{} S( X) _{a,b}^{i_{1},\ldots, i_{k}} e_{i_{1}} \cdot \ldots\cdot e_{i_{k}}
\end{equation}

The main reason why this is fundamental is because this is necessary to state the so-called Chens identity which states the relationship between concatenation and tensor product. First we define the concatenation of paths. That is. For two paths $X: \left[ a,b \right] \to \mathbb{R} ^{d}$  and $Y : \left[ b,c \right]
\to  \mathbb{R} ^{d}$, we define the concatenation as the path $X * Y : \left[ a,c \right]  \to \mathbb{R} ^{d}$, where the first part for $t \in  \left[ a,b \right] $ is $( X* Y) _{t} = X_{t}$, and for $t \in  \left[ b,c \right] $ we define $( X*Y)
_{t} = X_{b} + ( Y_{t} - Y_{b}) $. And the tensor product is simply defined joining the monomials, that is  $e_{i_{1}} \ldots e_{i_{k}} \otimes e_{j_{1}} \ldots e_{j_{m}}  = e_{i_{1}} \ldots e_{i_{k}}  e_{j_{1}} \ldots e_{j_{m}}$. Finally we can
state the relationship between these operators.

\begin{theorem}
    \textbf{Chens Identity.} Let $X: \left[ a,b \right] \to  \mathbb{R} ^{d}$ and $Y: \left[ b,c \right] \to \mathbb{R} ^{d}$ be two paths. Then we have the following identity,
    \begin{equation}
        S( X*Y) _{a,c} = S( X) _{a,b} \otimes  S( Y) _{b,c}
    \end{equation}

\end{theorem}


A very interesting property with the signature \eqref{eq:representation} is in fact time-reversible. For a path $X: \left[ a,b \right]  \to \mathbb{R} ^{d}$ we can define the time-reverse path $\overleftarrow{X}: \left[ a,b \right]  \to  \mathbb{R} ^{d} $, for
which $ \overleftarrow{X}  = X_{a+b -t}$. It can be shown that \begin{equation}
    S( X) _{a,b} \otimes S( \overleftarrow{X}) = 1.
\end{equation}
This can be understood that that the time-reverse is the "tensor" inverse for the signature $S( X) _{a,b}$.



\subsection{Rough paths}%
\label{sub:rough_paths}





One of the key properties of the shuffle product is that it enables the representation of the signature of a nonlinear function as a linear combination of iterated integrals. Moreover, we observe that the time reversal property, Chen's identity, and the invariance of the signature under time reparametrizations are preserved.

A natural question arises: what kind of information is captured by the signature?
Due to the invariance of time reparametrization, it is clear that we cannot reconstruct exact speed at which the path is traversed \cite{chevyrev2016primer}.
However, a another interesting propertie is that if we have a paramterized picture of a  path $X$ which never crossing itself, then we can completely describe the image and diraction of traversal of path. This implies that one can certainly
reconstruct geometrical properties, see \cite{lyons2017hyperbolic, chang2019insertion, geng2017reconstruction}
