\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}


Signatures has proved to be fundamental for several applications.
The theory is quite applicable in the algebraic theory of rough paths \cite{geng2021introduction}. This has showed to be a very interesting way to represent data because of the special properties of time reversial propertie and ivariance of time
reparamerization of representing data via signatures \cite{chevyrev2016primer}. In fact, in a
2013 competition focused on recognizing handwritten
Chinese characters, the winner represented the characters as arrays based on a "signature" from rough path theory, then classified them using a convolutional neural network \cite{yin2013icdar}.
Recently have we sen that it is clear that signatures can be a great tool of extracting geometric shape of any path given missing data.

Recently, it has become clear that signatures can be a powerful representation in machine learning for extracting the geometric shape of any path, even when data is missing \cite{chevyrev2016primer} and time series.


We will divide the report into two parts. One part for the fundamental properties of signatures and the second pat for the recent applications of this method. Spend some time evaluating signatures for


\todo[inline]{ Main idea is that the signature approach represent a non-parametric way of extraction of characteristics features of data.  }
